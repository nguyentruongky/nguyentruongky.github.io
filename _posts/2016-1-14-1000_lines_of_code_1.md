Have you ever write a file with more 500 lines of code? I think the answer is YES. Me too, even more 1000 lines. How can you maintain your code? And what do you think when fix a bug, add a function with a 1000-line-of-code file?  
I'm sure your feeling same to mine. It's horrible to find something there.

Take a look at this photo and list what we have to do.

- Design a view contain email and password TextField with a round corner.
- Design button `Sign In` with a round corner. 
- Add logo 
- Add 2 buttons below.
- Toggle enabled button `Sign In`.
-   Validate email and password.
-   Connect to service to login.
-   Handle error from service.
-   Handle error with not available internet.
-   Save log in result into local.
-   Show forgot password screen.

With a simple log in screen, there are 10+ small tasks to do. I don't want to mention to log in and sign up in the same screen. And the view controller will contain a lot of codes. It's horrible.

Thank God, Extension is here. Extension in Swift is awesome. If you don't know about Extension, read more [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Extensions.html).
I split up to 3 extension files:
-   FormattingUIExtension: contain with UI code, animation, effect. I call `setupView()` in `viewDidLoad()` to format the UI. I usually do that: set title, run animation, set text color, background, implement delegate in `setupView`.
-   DataValidationExtension: validate email, password, enabled or disabled button, keyboard when input data changed.
-   ServiceCommunicationExtension:
    -   Connect to service to login.
    -   Handle error from service.
    -   Handle error with not available internet.
    -   Save log in result into local.

And this is my ViewController.swift.

Now I want to add animation, find `FormattingUIExtension.swift` and code, service changes, do it in `ServiceCommunicationExtension.swift`

Don't add everything in view controller, split it up, manage it easily and forgot the 1000-line-of-code nightmare.
